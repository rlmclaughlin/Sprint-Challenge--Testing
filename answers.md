1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

The difference between describe and It is that Describe groups together related test. Essentially, you would nest related It test within the closures of Describe. It creates individual test cases that are targeted at specific elements, functions, endpoints, etc.  These It test cases fall within the closures of Describe.  

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
